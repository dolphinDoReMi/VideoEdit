# Resource Monitor Feature Branch - Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

Successfully created the `resource_monitor` feature branch with comprehensive background device resource monitoring implementation and consolidated documentation structure.

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Background Resource Monitoring Service
- **DeviceResourceService**: Foreground service for real-time CPU, memory, battery, temperature monitoring
- **ResourceUpdateReceiver**: Broadcast receiver for UI components to receive resource updates
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Added `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` permission
- **WhisperBatchResultsActivity**: Integrated with resource monitoring system
- **Service Features**:
  - 2-second update intervals
  - Broadcast system for real-time data distribution
  - Persistent notification for foreground service
  - Android 13+ compatible with `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED`

### 2. Documentation Consolidation
- **Main Doc/README.md**: Overview and quick start guide for all features
- **Whisper Documentation**: Complete architecture, implementation, and deployment guide
- **CLIP Documentation**: Video processing pipeline and control knots
- **UI Documentation**: WebView integration and accessibility support
- **Cursor Rules**: Development guidelines and testing requirements
- **Script Organization**: Moved relevant scripts to feature-specific directories

### 3. Documentation Structure

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- **Real-time Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, battery, temperature tracking
- **Background Service Architecture**: Independent service with broadcast communication
- **Cross-Platform Documentation**: Android, iOS, and macOS Web deployment guides
- **Control Knots**: Exposed configuration points for deterministic behavior
- **Verification Scripts**: Testing and validation procedures for each feature

### 5. Cleanup and Organization
- **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate documentation files
- **Script Organization**: Moved test scripts to appropriate feature directories
- **Archive Cleanup**: Removed old documentation from archive/old_docs/
- **Feature Separation**: Isolated resource monitoring changes in dedicated branch

## ðŸš€ Branch Status

- **Branch Name**: `resource_monitor`
- **Status**: âœ… Complete and pushed to remote
- **Commits**: 3 commits with comprehensive changes
- **Documentation**: Fully consolidated and organized
- **Testing**: Ready for validation and integration

## ðŸ“Š Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Validate resource monitoring service on Xiaomi Pad
2. **Integration**: Merge resource_monitor branch into main when ready
3. **Deployment**: Use consolidated documentation for deployment procedures
4. **Monitoring**: Track resource usage and performance metrics
