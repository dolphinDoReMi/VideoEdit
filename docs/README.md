## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts Organization

Scripts are organized to match the documentation structure:

### Architecture Scripts (`scripts/architecture/`)
- Architecture validation and compliance scripts

### Module Scripts (`scripts/modules/`)
- Testing, verification, and operations scripts
- Comprehensive test suites and validation

### DEV Changelog Scripts (`scripts/dev-changelog/`)
- Changelog management and versioning scripts

### Release Scripts (`scripts/release/`)
- Build, deployment, and distribution automation

### Tools (`scripts/tools/`)
- Utility scripts and helper tools
- Thread suffix generation for CI/CD

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Get thread suffix for isolated builds
THREAD=$(./scripts/thread_suffix.sh)

# Build with per-thread app ID
./gradlew :app:installDebug -PappIdSuffix="$THREAD"

# Run tests
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PappIdSuffix="$THREAD"
```

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated builds with per-thread app ID suffixing
- **Conditional Testing**: Runs relevant tests based on changed files
- **Artifact Management**: Uploads builds with thread suffix naming

### Documentation
- **Architecture**: Start with `docs/architecture/README.md`
- **Modules**: Check `docs/modules/README.md` for feature guides
- **Release**: See `docs/release/README.md` for deployment
- **Changelog**: Review `docs/dev-changelog/DEV_CHANGELOG.md`

## üìã Key Features

### Per-Thread App ID Isolation
- **Android**: `com.mira.com.t.<THREAD>` for parallel installs
- **iOS**: `com.mira.com.t.<THREAD>` for parallel installs
- **Deterministic**: Branch+commit SHA for consistent IDs

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated Builds**: GitHub Actions with conditional testing
- **Artifact Management**: Suffix-based naming for easy mapping
- **Cross-Platform**: Android (active), iOS (stubbed)

### Documentation Consolidation
- **4-Thread Structure**: Logical organization
- **Duplicate Removal**: Single source of truth
- **Copy-Pasteable Commands**: Ready-to-use examples
